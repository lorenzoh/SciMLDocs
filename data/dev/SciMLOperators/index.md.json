It gives the common set of functions and traits which solvers can rely on for properly performing their tasks. Along with that, SciMLOperators.jl provides definitions for the basic standard operators which are used in building blocks for most tasks, both simplifying the use of operators while also demonstrating to users how such operators can be built and used in practice."],"type":"node"},{"attributes":{},"tag":"h2","children":["Why SciMLOperators?"],"type":"node"},{"attributes":{},"tag":"p","children":["SciMLOperators.jl has the design that is required in order to be used in all scenarios of equation solvers.
